# Understanding the FFT
This repository is my attempt at trying to explain the core of FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithms in simple terms. I will start off with the regular Fourier Transform, then transition into the DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) and finally the FFT. Towards the end, I plan on elucidating the FFT with real world examples in the Julia programming language.

# Prerequisites
-  Basic calculus 
-  Rudimentary knowledge of programming (I don't think its necessary to be proficient in Julia to understand the code given here)
-  Familiarity with circuits (namely RLC circuits)
