# Understanding the FFT
This repository is my attempt at trying to explain the core of FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) algorithms in simple terms. I will start off with the regular Fourier Transform, then transition into the DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) and finally the FFT. Towards the end, I plan on elucidating the FFT with real world examples in the Julia programming language.
